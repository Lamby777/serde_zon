# serde_zon

Experimental ZON library for Rust

_**⚠ WARNING ⚠**_

This library is still really incomplete. Don't use it for anything serious.
Also, I'm just going off of a couple sources I found + reading the Zig compiler
source code, and I'm not sure if this even fits the ZON format spec. If you find
a railroad diagram like the one on [JSON.org](https://json.org), feel free to
complain about my incorrect implementation or open an issue with a picture of
the diagram. :)
